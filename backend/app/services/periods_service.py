Historical periods data service.

Update: the data now loads straight from the GitHub repo (Data/silver/
periods_en.csv) instead of Azure Blob Storage — no Azure credentials
needed for this file anymore.

Also serves the "Did You Know?" trivia list (see `get_fun_facts` below)
so the frontend fetches it instead of hardcoding it client-side.
